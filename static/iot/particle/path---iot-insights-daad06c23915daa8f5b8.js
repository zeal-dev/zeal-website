Particle's operating system, Device OS, perfectly captures this differentator because it facilities the complex integration between hardware, firmware, and network connectivity on all Particle devices.\n\nManaging this complex integration is often underestimated as a nontrivial responsibility, but it is a large reason why 75% of companies that bite off new IoT initiatives fail to deliver them on time. The most successful companies are the ones that work with their IoT partners at every level of integration, not leave the hard work to you.
