Originally designed for application in schools, StaffAlerter can be customized to send alerts, and receive and issue commands during practically any type of emergency situation. With Particle, StaffAlerter has found a highly adaptable, responsive, and comprehensive platform to scale and evolve their life-saving product."},highlights:{value:"### Setting & challenges:\n- Growing concern over terror attacks and extreme weather events has led to a growing demand for emergency notification and response systems\n- The current “gold-standard” solution for emergency notification is the Mass Alert System (MAS). However, this solution is limited in its functionality, and prohibitively expensive ($30,000+) for most organizations\n- Mass Alert Systems also aren’t designed to integrate with existing infrastructures, such as emergency phone systems and sensors.\n\n### Results:\n- StaffAlerter uses the Photon, Electron, and smart sensors to produce a highly-customizable, IoT-based Mass Alert System\n- StaffAlerter provides significantly more functionality than traditional MASs for a fraction of the price (< $2,000)\n- Can be used for dozens of applications, including: bomb threat notification, automated gunshot alerting, industrial monitoring, severe weather alerts, emergency remote door locking and unlocking, and more.\n- Particle hardware and cloud platform provide StaffAlerter with the speed and flexibility required to develop a wide variety of integrations and applications"},conclusion:null,about:{value:"StaffAlerter is an innovative mass alerts solution made by PM Power Products.
