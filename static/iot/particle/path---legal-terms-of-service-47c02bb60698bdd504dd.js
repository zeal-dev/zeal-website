Particle offers online service that integrates with the individual items of hardware that have been provisioned to access Particle’s cloud and imported into Particle’s systems (each, a “**Device**”) to perform various Internet of Things related tasks and functions (the “**Hosted Service**”). Certain services and functionalities available via the Hosted Service are free of charge.  However, Particle may, in its sole discretion charge fees in connection with certain services, such as limiting the number of Events (as defined below) that may be performed.  As used herein, an “**Event**” means any HTTP/HTTPS request made by the Hosted Service to a third party service(s), including without limitation, via webhooks or integrations or any discrete message sent via integrations, websockets or server sent event (SSE) streams by the Hosted Service to any third party service(s).\n\n1.2 _Accounts_.\n\n(a) _Freemium and Paid Accounts_.  In order to use certain features of the Hosted Service, you must  register for an account with Particle (an “**Account**”). We offer two types of Accounts: a free version (“**Freemium Account**”), and a paid account (“**Premium Account**”).  Users with Freemium Accounts shall be able to use the Hosted Services on a limited basis, as the amount of Events that may be performed and Devices included under a Freemium Account are limited to the number of Events set forth on our pricing page.\n\n(b) _Registration Information_.  You represent and warrant that: (i) all required registration information you submit is truthful and accurate; and (ii) you will maintain the accuracy of such information. Particle may suspend or terminate your Account if you breach any of the terms of this Agreement. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account login information and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your Account. You agree to immediately notify Particle of any unauthorized use, or suspected unauthorized use, of your Account, or any other breach of security. Particle will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above requirements.\n\n## 2. LICENSED USES AND RESTRICTIONS\n\n2.1 _Access Grant_.

If no license agreement accompanies use of the Software, use of the Software will be governed by this Agreement.
