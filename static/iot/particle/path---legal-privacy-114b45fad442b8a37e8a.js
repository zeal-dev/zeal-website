This data is collected via the following methods:\n\n2.1.1 Particle, like many other websites, will store session information (often called “Cookies”) in your browser that will help Particle to identify information such as browsing activity, IP addresses and page view order. You do have the option to not use these Cookies; the majority of browsers will have a “help” tool that will help you to prevent Cookies if you want to, but Particle recommends you keep Cookies active as it will provide a better user experience on Particle’s Websites.\n\n2.1.2 When You visit Particle Websites, Particle web servers automatically log typical website analytic data from visitors to our site. This data, which may include details such as browser type, IP addresses, site visit length and referral URL, is used for systems administration, detecting use patterns and generally improving customer experience.\n\n2.1.3 Particle sees and logs non-personally identifiable data when You use Particle Services.
