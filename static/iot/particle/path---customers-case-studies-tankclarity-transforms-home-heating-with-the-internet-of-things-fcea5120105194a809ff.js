This oil is typically stored in giant oil tanks housed in basements and periodically re-filled by licensed oil distributing companies. This process of monitoring, order, and refilling is not only inefficient but cumbersome. Thankfully, with Particle, TankClarity has created a smart sensor that automatically notifies homeowners and fuel delivery companies when home fuel levels are low, which saves both parties time and money. \n"},highlights:{value:"- TankClarity shipped their IoT solution to market in just 7 months with Particle\n- TankClarity improved their device installation time to 2 minutes due to the Particle platform’s ease of accessibility. \n- TankClarity has deployed 700 IoT devices out in the field and intends to deploy more with Particle."},conclusion:{value:"With over 700 units already deployed, and rapidly adoption growing rapidly, TankClarity appears to have a bright future.
